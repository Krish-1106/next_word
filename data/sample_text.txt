The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. A watched pot never boils. Actions speak louder than words. All that glitters is not gold. Better late than never. Birds of a feather flock together. Cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. Easy come, easy go. Every cloud has a silver lining. Fortune favors the bold. The grass is always greener on the other side. Honesty is the best policy. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Knowledge is power. Laughter is the best medicine. Life is what you make it. Love conquers all. Money doesn't grow on trees. Necessity is the mother of invention. Practice makes perfect. The early bird catches the worm. Time flies when you're having fun. Two wrongs don't make a right. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. You can't judge a book by its cover. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. All good things must come to an end. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
